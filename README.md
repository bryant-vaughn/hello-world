My name is Bryant Vaughn and I'm a student at MSU Denver pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. In my spare time I enjoy learning new things and working on my programming skills. My background is in finance where I was a FINRA licensed stokebroker for one of the largest investment firms in the country. My passions include computers, cars and traveling around the world.
